## Implementation of design from scratch

<p>Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:</p>
- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
