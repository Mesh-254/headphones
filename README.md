## Implementation of design from scratch

<p>Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:</p>
- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

### 0. Read and be familiar with Figma

mandatory
Create an account in Figma and open this <a ahref="https://www.figma.com/file/TwFqqWGYvNYvxZxhdWXv4H/Holberton-School---Headphone-company">project</a> and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

If you can’t access to it, please find here the Figma file

Important notes with Figma:

- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- some values are in float - feel free to round them
  For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

### 1. Header

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

Here an archive of all assets needed: images\_.zip


### 2. "What we do..." section

Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

### 3. "Our results" section

Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

### 4. Contact us

Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

### 5. Footer

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!

When you are done, here the result:


### 6. Replace background image with... code!

In the section “Our results”; without the use of an image file, draw each pentagon using HTML and CSS.

7. Let's animate items

From 4-index.html and 4-styles.css, add fun animations to “What we do…” and “Our results” sections items row. Either all the time, either when hover.

Scaling, opacity, rotation, bouncing… many options!
